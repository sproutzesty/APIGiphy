This is a Concept Website using the Giphy API currently all rating are available. 

This website allows the user to type in an phrase, animal, ect in to the search
area and have access to the Giphy API. 

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JS

Future Improvments includes,
1. The ability to choose how many gifs on the landing page, the Rating and the content. Allowing for more customization. 
2. Allow the user to post from the website directly to their social media, or like. 
3. offer other options, Giphy now offers other things than just Gifs, there are stickers, facial reading programs, ect. 
   Adding these would give the user more reason to use this platform over others offered.
